            <p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio. I am 39 years old, and I have a beautiful wife and an adorable dog. I started out my career like most people—graduating high school without a clue in the world what I was going to do.  It was in the mid 90’s that I first realized that I was interested in computers. I was 11 or 12 years old when I first saw the movie "Hackers'' starring Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, and Matthew Lillard. After seeing the movie I was hooked, I started spending all my time in the computer lab at school, I would read the Windows 95 manual while on lunch, I would even make my own laptops out of Legos and wood. As I got older my passion for computers and coding would dwindle but it never disappeared, I toyed around with HTML while styling my Myspace page. Fast forward to now and I'm finally starting my journey in coding and web development.</p>

        <h3>HTML Fun Facts</h3>
        <br>
        <p>As per HTML5 specification, alt is a mandatory attribute for the img tag. However, you can assign it an empty string when the image is only for decoration purposes.</p>

        <h3>CSS Fun Facts</h3>
        <br>
        <p>With CSS we can make better backgrounds. So backgrounds not any more need to be boring and static. Previously, we needed some additional programming and scripting, but now this can easily be done with CSS3.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript Fun Fact</h3>
        <br>
        <p>JavaScript was written in just 10 days! - Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

    <h3 class="sample-title">Project 1
      <p>In Project 1, we wanted to solve your boredom issues.  Welcome to Oh So Bored, the place to go if you're bored! (elaborate)
         It's very simple at first: there will be a large button with a dropdown menu next to it, and a modal in the lower right corner. The dropdown can be used to filter which types of responses Bored API returns. Upon pushing the button, two cards will appear below the button. The top card will have the suggestion of what to do from the Bored API. Below that will be three GIFs from giphy all relevant to the suggestion Bored API gave. If the first suggestion isn't to your liking, push the large button again to get a different suggestion. The modal can be used to share a GIF you found funny on FaceBook, and will eventually be used to send newsletters out to those who so desire them.
